# My Project

This is a Next.js project that uses Supabase for the backend.

## Getting Started

First, you'll need to create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```

You can get these values from your Supabase project settings.

Next, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
